It's been 7 months since we saw one of the most dramatic stock market crashes due to Covid-19. Stock prices plumetted with the S&P 500 falling more than 12% in March of 2020. After weeks of record breaking decline and circuit breakers in the market, Wall Street has made a meteroric recovery. The S&P 500 closed at an all-time high in August. It took only 5 months to rise from the pandemic hysteria selloff.

Main street tells a different story. The economy lost an estimate of 22 million jobs in March and April due to the coronavirus shutdown according to the Labor Department's survey of business establishments. With retail shops and restaurants closing permanently and the GDP predicted to shrink, regular people living from paycheck to paycheck are finding it difficult to pay for necessities. 

How can Wall Street be doing so well at a time when unemployment numbers are at the Great Depression levels? Maybe the answer lies in the Federal Reserve. In response to an economic shutdown that could place a lot of American businesses insolvent, the Fed poured record breaking money into the financial markets. The Fed printed $3 trillion to ensure that liquidity is not an issue during the pandemic. The Fed convinced Wall Street. Implications of the Fed's actions isn't what I want to talk about here. It's more appropriate for another time.

While the Fed took monetary policy to ensure the money printer keeps printing, it cannot directly pass the money onto the people. Congress has the fiscal power to provide stimulus directly to small businesses. However, bipartisan issues have kept Congress busy. 

So if the money isn't going directly to small businesses, then where is the money going? It's going directly into assets such as stocks. This is where the divergence plays out. My hypothesis is the influx of new capital rushing in at record volume is poured into stocks, particularly certain industries such as Technology, despite horrible earnings per share numbers.
